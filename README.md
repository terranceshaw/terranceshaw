### Yep

Not a lot more else to say about myself. Been in the Navy longer than I ever thought I would be, but... almost done. Then I can retreat into the safety of my home and never come out.

Like Willy Wonka.

Except less handsome.

I've got decent skills in PHP and MYSQL, as well as jQuery, HTML, and CSS. Also currently trying to break back into Swift development since SwiftUI has gotten a good deal more mature.
